autodivider
===========

jQuery Mobile example of convering a select list to something more mobile-friendly. I've pretty much taken the base
code from jQM's autodivider link bar.  My goal is to create a plugin that is useful on mobile devices and also 
on larger screens.  Adding an autocomplete feature will help.

Also, I'd like to be able to plug this into a select list and render the UI in the demo.
